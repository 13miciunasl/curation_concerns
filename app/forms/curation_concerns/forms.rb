module CurationConcerns
 # This will be the module for containing forms
 # @since 0.14.0
 # Forms are a type of data structures that include validation that leverage hydra editor
 # capabilities. Their purpose is to allow users to edit and save objects based on models.
 # The impetus for their creation was to remove validation from models. A form must define
 # the model it uses and attributes it manipulates. It may include default values and define
 # required fields.
 # They are ruby objects that are typically instantiated by the controller to facilitate
 # user creation, editing, or deleting of an object.
